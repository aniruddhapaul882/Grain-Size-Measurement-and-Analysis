# With the PM2, you donâ€™t need the while loop anymore, you can keep your code clean and left the restart job to PM2. The command to run your script with 10-second sleep after each job would look like this:
# Jump into the directory where the python script is present
$ pm2 start main.py --name job1-10s-delay --interpreter python3 --restart-delay 10000
