# Grain-Size-Measurement-and-Analysis
Measuring Grains from live Cam-feed

## Calculation for pixel to distance ratio
1. Take a photo with the deployed camera
2. Open the photo with a image/photo analyser application and measure the pixel distance between any two point, let say A and B
3. Measure the physical distance of point A and B using a measuring tape in a particular unit, let say Milimetre
4. pixel to Distance ratio = physical distance / pixel diastance
